For instance, consider the string ABRACADABRA.

Input characters are only present in the leaves. Internal nodes have a character value of Ï• (NULL).
We can determine that our values for characters are:
A - 0
B - 111
C - 1100
D - 1101
R - 10

Our Huffman encoded string is:
A B    R  A C     A D     A B    R  A
0 111 10 0 1100 0 1101 0 111 10 0
or
