https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1,
compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Example 1:
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1].
In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

Example 2:
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]

Output: 9
